HTML/html
html stand for HyperText Markup Language. It is the most basic building block of the Web that defines the meaning and structure of web content.
html pages are text documents.
html uses tags (characters that sit inside angled brackets) to give the information they surround special meaning.
Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes the end.
Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more about the content of that element.
Attributes require a name and a value.
Therefore, to learn html one need to know what tags are available for use, what they do, and where they can go.
