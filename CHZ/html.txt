HTML/html
html stand for HyperText Markup Language. It is the most basic building block of the Web that defines the meaning and structure of web content.
html pages are text documents.
html uses tags (characters that sit inside angled brackets) to give the information they surround special meaning.
Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes the end.
Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more about the content of that element.
Attributes require a name and a value.
Therefore, to learn html one need to know what tags are available for use, what they do, and where they can go.


TAGS, STRUCTURE AND TEXT
TAGS
 < > is an opening tag.
 </ > is a closing tag.
 
 STRUCTURE
 <html> is an html opening tag.
 </html> is an html closing tag.
 <body> is a body opening tag.
 </body> is a body closing tag.
 Everything inside the body element is shown inside the main browser window.
 
 <head> is a head opening tag.
 <head> is a head closing tag.
 Before the body element one will often see a head element which contains information about the page (rather than information that is shown within the main part of the browser window.
 
 <title> is a title opening tag.
 <title> is a title closing tag.
 The contents of the title element are either shown in the top of the browser, above where we usually type in the URL of the page we want to visit, or on the tab.
 
 <section> is a section opening tag.
 </section> is a section closing tag.
 The section tag defines the section of documents such as chapters, headers, footers or any other sections.
 
 TEXTS
 Headings
 <h1> is a first level heading opening tag.
 </h1> is  first level heading closing tag.
 <h2> is a second level heading opening tag.
 </h2> is  second level heading closing tag.
 <h3> is a thid level heading opening tag.
 </h3> is  third level heading closing tag
 <h4> is a fourth level heading opening tag.
 </h4> is a fourth level heading closing tag.
 <h5> is a fifth level heading opening tag.
 </h5> is  fifth level heading closing tag.
 <h6> is a sixth or final level heading opening tag.
 </h6> is  sixth or final level heading closing tag.
 Browsers display the contents of headings at different sizes. The contents of an <h1> element is the largest, and the contents of an <h6> element is the smallest.
 
 Paragraph
 <P> is a paragraph opening tag.
 </p> is a paragraph closing tag.
 The paragraph tag defines a paragraph. To create a paragraph, one has to surround the words that make up the paragraph with an opening <p> tag and closing </p> tag.
 By default, a browser will show each paragraph on a new line with some space between it and any subsequent paragraphs.

 Bold and Italics
 <b> is an opening tag to make characters bold.
 </b> is a closig tag to make characters bold.
 By enclosing words in the tags <b> and </b> we can make characters appear bold.
 The <b></b> tag also represents a section of text that would be presented in a visually different way (for example key words in a paragraph) although the use of the <b> element does not imply any additional meaning.
 
 <i> is an opening tag to make characters italic.
 </i> is a closig tag to make characters italic.
 By enclosing words in the tags <i> and </i> we can make characters appear italic.
 The <i> element also represents a section of text that would be said in a different way from surrounding content — such as technical terms, names of ships, foreign words, thoughts, or other terms that would usually be italicized.
 
 superscript and subscript
 <sup> is an opening tag for superscripting characters.
 </sup> is a closing tag for superscripting characters.
 
 <sub> is an opening tag for subscripting characters.
 <sub> is a closing tag for subscripting characters.
 
 White Space
 In order to make code easier to read, web page authors often add extra spaces or start some elements on new lines.
 When the browser comes across two or more spaces next to each other, it only displays one space. Similarly if it comes across a line break, it treats that as a single space too. This is known as white space collapsing.
 
 Line Break and Horizontal Rules
 <br /> is a line break tag.
 <hr /> is a tag to add horizontal rule between sections.
 There are a few elements that do not have any words between an opening and closing tag. They are known as empty elements and they are written differently.
 An empty element usually has only one tag. Before the closing angled bracket of an be a space and a forward slash character.
 
 Visual editors and their Code View
 Visual editors often resemble word processors. Although each editor will differ slightly, there are some features that are common to most editors that allow you to control the presentation of text.
 If you copy and paste text from a program that allows you to format text (such as Word) into a visual editor, it may add extra markup. To prevent this copy the text into a plain text editor first and then copy it from that program and
 paste it into the visual editor.
 Code views show you the code created by the visual editor so you can manually edit it, or so you can just enter new code yourself. It is often activated using a button with an icon that says HTML or has angled brackets. White space may be added to the code by the editor to make the code easier to read
 In Visual Editors, Headings are created by highlighting text then using a drop-down box to select a heading; Bold and italic text are created by highlighting some text and pressing a b or i button; New paragraphs are created using the return or the enter key; Line breaks are created by pressing the shift key and the return key at the same time; and Horizontal rules are created using a button with a straight line on it.
 
 Semantic Markup
 Semantic markup  help when adding text to web pages.
 Browsers often display the contents of these elements in a different way.
 The reason for using these elements is that other programs, such as screen readers or search engines, can use this extra information.
 <strong> is an opening semantic markup tag  used to indicates that its content has strong importance. 
 </strong> is a closing semantic markup tag  used to indicates that its content has strong importance. 
 By default, browsers will show the contents of a strong element in bold.
 
 <em> is an opening semantic markup tag  used to indicate emphasis.
 </em> is a closing semantic markup tag  used to indicate emphasis.
 Emphasis semantic markup subtly changes the meaning of a sentence.
 By default browsers will show the contents of an <em> element in italic.
 
 Quotations
 There are two elements commonly used for marking up quotations; <blockquote> and <q>.
 The <blockquote> element is used for longer quotes that take up an entire paragraph. Browsers tend to indent the contents of the <blockquote> element, however you should not use this element just to indent a piece of text — rather you should achieve this effect using CSS.
 The <q> element is used for shorter quotes that sit within a paragraph. Browsers are supposed to put quotes around the <q> element, however Internet Explorer does not — therefore many people avoid using the <q> element.
 Both <blockquote> and <q> elements may use the cite attribute to indicate where the quote is from. Its value should be a URL that will have more information about the source of the quotation.
 
 abbreviations and acronyms
 <abbr> is an opening sentantic markup used to abbreviate words or characters
 <abbr> is a closing sentantic markup used to abbreviate words or characters
 A title attribute on the opening tag is used to specify the full term.
 Note that, in HTML 4 there was a separate <acronym> element for acronyms. To spell out the full form of the acronym, the title attribute was used (as with the <abbr> element above). HTML5 just uses the <abbr> element for both abbreviations and acronyms.
 
 Citations and Definitions
 <cite> is an opening semantic markup used when citing work such as a book, film or research paper.
 </cite> is a closing semantic markup used when citing work such as a book, film or research paper.
 The <cite> element can be used to indicate where the citation is from. Note, in HTML5, <cite> should not really be used for a person's name — but it was allowed in HTML 4, so most people are likely to continue to use it. Browsers will render the content of a <cite> element in italics.
 <dfn> is an opening semantic markup used when defining a term, concept, or statement.
 </dfn> is a closing semantic markup used when defining a term, concept, or statement.
 <dfn></dfn> is used the first time you explain some new terminology (perhaps an academic concept or some jargon) in a document, it is known as the defining instance of it.
 The <dfn> element is used to indicate the defining instance of a new term.
 Note, some browsers show the content of the <dfn> element in italics. Safari and Chrome do not change its appearance.
 
 Authors Details
 <address> <cite> is an opening semantic markup used when proving the address.
 <address> <cite> is a closing semantic markup used when proving the address.
 The <address> element has quite a specific use: to contain contact details for the author of the page.
 It can contain a physical address, but it does not have to. It may also contain a phone number or email address.
 Browsers often display the content of the <address> element in italics.
 
 Changes to Content
 <ins> is an opening semantic markup used when inserting changes to contents. 
 </ins> is a closing semantic markup used when inserting changes to contents.
 <ins></ins> cab mostly be used when proofrading and edditing.
 <del> is an opening semantic markup element used show text that has been deleted from it.
 <del> is a closing semantic markup element used show text that has been deleted from it.
 The content of a <ins> element is usually underlined, while the content of a <del> element usually has a line through it.
 However, to indicates something that is no longer accurate or relevant (but that should not be deleted), <s></s> tags are used.
 Visually the content of an <s> element will usually be displayed with a line through the center.
 Older versions of HTML had a <u> element for content that was underlined, but this is being phased out.
